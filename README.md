# HR_Analytics_Dashboard
I used Power Bi to create an interactive Dashboard for the HR Data , based on different departments. 
After Analyzing HR data, i came up with questions that might be useful in drawing insights from the data. 

Key questions- 
1. What is the total Number of employees?
2. How many employees left the company(Attrition) ?
3. Attrition rate?
4. Average age of employees?
5. Average income of employees?
6. Average years of eomployees at company?
7. Does education Field has any relation with Attrition of employees?
8. Relation between Attrition and Age of employees?
9. Has the Job role impacted Attrition of employees?
10. Does income affect Attrition?
11. Is there any relation with Work years at company and Attrition of employees?
12. How many Women and Men have left the company?

I also added slicers based on different departments to filter out the data for each Department so it can be used by all departments to monitor Attrition rate of employees and it's causes.
